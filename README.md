# Buffer-Overflow-Exploit
In this project we will focus on creating a server that is vulnerable to buffer overflow and how an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain access to the victim. We will be looking deeply in creating both the server and the attacker using programing languages like C and Python. Also how this risk can be avoided and mitigated. From the attacker side we would be creating a buffer overflow payload using tcp bind shell which will give access to victimâ€™s command shell. This project would cover most part of the Stack Overflow and a live example of how it works and how to be safe and mitigate these threats.
